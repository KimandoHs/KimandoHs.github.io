					<h3>The Facts</h3>
					<p>The Salem Witch Trials began in 1692 when girls began expericing illnesses and symptoms not yet explainable by science. The afflicted girls began making accusations of witchcraft, the first accusations being against Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne. During the course of the trials, 19 people were executed, one was tortuted to death for refusing to testify, and a few others died while in prison. In September of 1692, 'spectral evidence' became inadmissable in court, leading fewer people to be found guilty. In the May of 1693, the governor released prisoners that were found guilty on account of spectral evidence, marking the end of the Salem Witch Trials. </p>

					<h3>The Myths</h3>
						<p>The Salem Witch Trials marked the introduction of the use of 'spectral evidence', the idea that a Witch's spirit would attack or perform otherwise witchly activities. Many of the witness testimonies of the accusers included such spectral evidence. Many examples of this can be found in the trial of Bridget Bishop. John Louder, for example, claimed that Bishop's spirit attacked him in his bed at night, and then threatened him once he confronted her. <a href="#section2">[2]</a> Despite the large volume of accusations using spectral evidence, nothing has ever been found to support such evidence. </p>

					<h3>The Facts</h3>
					<p>In 1874, work on the Hoosac Tunnel was completed. The construction of the tunnel had taken over 20 years, was extremely expensive, and dangerous as well. 196 workers died over the course of its construction. The project is known for being incredibly ambitious, with the tunnel going through the Hoosac Mountain Range.</p>
					<p>Because of the number of workers who died during construction, the Hoosac Tunnel has been nicknamed 'The Bloody Pit'. </p>
					<h3>The Myths</h3>
					<p>There have been documented claims of "disembodied voices, orbs, and some of the original miners have even claimed that some of their own were killed by ghosts." <a href="#section4">[4]</a></p>
