					<h2 id="Desoto" style = "border-bottom: 1px solid #a2a9b1;">DeSoto House Hotel</h2>
					<p>The DeSoto House Hotel located in down Galenga, Illinois, is said to be haunted by 'the Lady in Black', a story that has been told for over 100 years. This story had gained popularity when a flood in Galena led to the plaster in the hotel being torn down. Behind the wall, a doorway was discovered, which to this day the Lady in Black is rumored to walk through.  <a href="#section1">[1]</a>.  </p>
					<h2 id="Munger" style = "border-bottom: 1px solid #a2a9b1;">Munger Road</h2>
					<p>Munger Road is a road in Illinois that grew in infamy after being associated with the legend that a school bus full of children got stuck on its tracks, and was hit by a train, killing everyone on it. According to Pam Rodleder, Bartlett History Museum director, there was no conclusive evidence that this legend was based on any sort of truth. However, it has been speculated that this legend could be based on a similar incident that happened in San Antonio. <a href="#section2">[2]</a>.  </p>
