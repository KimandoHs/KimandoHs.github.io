					<p>The University of Northern Iowa has reportedly been the site of ghosts and hauntings. According to Briddle, UNI is home to two ghosts: Zelda and Augie.   </p>
					<h3>Augie</h3>
					<p>Augie is the more well-known of the two, and is believed to be a World War II veteran who died in Lawther Hall. Although he was initially reported to reside in Lawther Hall, he has been spotted in other parts of the residence hall as well.<p>
					<h3>Zelda</h3>
					<p>The other ghost commonly associated with the University of Northern Iowa is Zelda, who is known to be a benevolent ghost. Zelda is descibed as being "the spirit of the theatre that is neither seen nor heard". Many people who work in the theatre seem to have a story about Zelda. Her most famous story tells about how she guided a loose electrical cable to land on the one open seat out of a nearly fully packed theatre. Other stories talk about how she comes out when all the lights are shut off. <a href="#section1">[1]</a></p>
