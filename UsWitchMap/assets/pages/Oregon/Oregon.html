					<p>There is an urban legend at the University of Oregon that years ago, a group of students found a door labeled "Archives" in the basement of a university building. Beyond that door was a bunch of doors and hallways that seemed abandoned. The rooms were full of empty boxes, except for one that had the inscription of 'Gail'. After further research, they had learned that a student named Gail had been killed there and had been haunting the archives. <a href="#section1">[1]</a>.  </p>
