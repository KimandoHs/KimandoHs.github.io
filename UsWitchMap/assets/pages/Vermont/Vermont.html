					<p>Carrie Anna Wheeler was murdered on May 29, 1897 by Lena Merilla Brewster, better known as Mildred.  Anna, a 17 year old woman at the time, had plans to meet her fiancé, Jack Wheeler, on the day she was murdered. According to a interview conducted by The Bridge, Mildred was supposedly jealous of Anna's relationship with Jack, being heard saying to Anna, "Jack Wheeler can't be engaged to us both; we will have to let him decide." Mildred and Anna walked nearby Jack's house, when Mildred shot Anna before shooting herself. Anna would die later that day, while Mildred would go on to survive her injuries. In court, Mildred would plead insanity. Although Jack initially claimed that "he had never given any attention to Mildred", he is said to have retracted that statement, admitting that the two of them had been intimate at some point. <a href="#section1">[1]</a></p>
