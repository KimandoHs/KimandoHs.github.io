					<p>Maricopa Hall is a residential dorm at the University of Arizona. Despite still being in use, it has its fair share of ghost stories and urban legends. Local lore has it that the hall was originally built at the location where a big fight took place in the 1860s, resulting in the hall being haunted with the voices of arguing and screaming women on dark nights. Another legend associated with Maricopa Hall dates back to 1919. It is said that a woman attending the University of Arizona, and who was also the daughter of a wealthy baron, had gotten engaged to a man. The only problem was that this man was cheating on her. The affair would lead her to commit suicide later, and there have been reports of people either hearing or seeing her ghostly spirit crying outside of the hall ever since. <a href="#section1">[1]</a>  </p>
