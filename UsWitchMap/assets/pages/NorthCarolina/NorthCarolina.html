					<p>The North Carolina Executive Mansion was completed in 1891. The governor at the time, Daniel Fowle, moved in and had a new bed made. Unfortunuately, he passed away three months after moving in. When governor Robert Scott moved in, he had Fowle's bed replaced. From that moment on, there would be a loud knocking behind the headboard at roughly the same time every night. The knocking would continue until governor Roy Cooper moved Fowle's bed back into the bedroom. It is believed that the loud knocking was Fowle's spirit demanding his bed be moved back. <a href="#section1">[1]</a>.  </p>
