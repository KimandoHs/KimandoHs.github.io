					<p>In North Dakota, there exists a butte which people say is haunted. This belief stems from reports of people seeing lights coming from the top of it. Aftering driving there to investigate, the light would seemingly disappear. Some claim that the light is a "lantern carried by the ghost of Ole Ziner -- who was shot and killed near the butte by another man over a property dispute." The idea is that the ghost of Ole Ziner climbs the top of the butte with a lantern to look for his head which was blown off. Others believe that the answer is much simpler, that its the reflection from cars nearby. <a href="#section1">[1]</a>  </p>
