					<p>Local lore in the Maryland includes the legend at Deep Creek Lake State Park. Allegedly, a man got a snowmobile for Christmas and decided to try it out with 6 of his friends at this lake. However, the ice was not frozen all the way through and legend has it that three of them died. The man's wife supposedly saw him standing outside their house later that night before melting away, and being replaced by a police officer there to report his death to the wife. <a href="#section1">[1]</a>.  </p>
