					<h3>The Facts</h3>
					<p>Heaaven's Gate was a cult originating from San Diego in the 1970s<a href="#section1">[1]</a>. The cults founders were Marshall Applewhite, known as Do, and Bonnie Nettles, known as Ti. Heaven's Gate shared unique beliefs that humans should shed their human nature in order to ascend to the next stage. Members of Heaven's Gate were taught that they would make this journey via a UFO, earning the religion the nickname as the UFO religion. This UFO would supposedly come to Earth one day to save true believers. However, by the 1980s, the number of members in Heaven's Gate had already began to steeply decline. </p>
					<p>On March 26, 1997, 39 dead bodies were found in a house near San Diego, after Heaven's Gate's leader, Marshall Applewhite, encouraged members to participate in a mass suicide. </p>
