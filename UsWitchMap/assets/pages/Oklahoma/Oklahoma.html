					<p>According to local lore, The Masonic Children's Home in Oklahoma supposedly had a strict headmistress who cruelly punished children that misbehaved. Apparently, the punishments were so severe that it led a staff member to commit suicide in the building's bell tower. It has been said that you can "see this shadow figure fall down and hang by the neck" if you are in the tower at midnight. It has also been said that visitors and passer bys have heard children laughing or seen them running around years after the place had shut down. <a href="#section1">[1]</a>  </p>
