					<p>The Hotel Alex Johnson is known as one of the most haunted hotels in the state of South Dakota. The Lady in White is the most well-known ghost story originating from this hotel. The origin of this urban legend takes place during the 1970s: it is said that the lady was a young bride who committed suicide in room 812. However, it was speculated by people close to her that she was far too happy as a person to have done such a thing. People suspected foul play with money as the motive. Nonetheless, to this day it is ruled as a suicide. There have been reports of a woman wandering the eigth floor in white gown.  <a href="#section1">[1]</a>  </p>
