					<p>Eunice Cole, better known as Goody Cole, is the only woman to ever be convicted of practicing witchcraft in the state of New Hampshire. She was arrested in 1656, and sentenced to a life sentence in a prison in Boston. She petitioned the court for a pardon after spending six xyears in prison, so that she could care for her husband. However, the court would only agree if she could pay her board bill and court costs, which she could not. The court finally agreed to release her in 1665, on the condition that she return to Hampton. However, she remained in jail until 1670 because she could not afford to pay for transportation. Back in Hampton, her neighbors reluctantly agreed to paying for her living expenses, thinking that she would not live much longer. When she showed no signs of being close to death, her neighbors took her to court and accused her of witchcraft. Although she was found not guilty, her neighbors were no longer responsible for paying for her living expenses. Goody Cole then had to survive by scavenging food such as fish, nuts, berries, and fruits. After not being seen for a few days, Goody Cole was found dead in her shack by a sent delegation. </p>
					<p>Over the past 300 years, a number of weird events have happened that many consider to be the doing of Goody Cole. For example, soon after Goody Cole died, a boat full of people was capsized, resulting in the deaths of all of them. This was particularly weird since the boat was found to be within swimming distance of land. Since then, there have been numerous claims of her spirit being seen walking around Hampton and disappearing. <a href="#section1">[1]</a></p>
