        <div id="sneakAttack"> 
            <h3>Sneak Attack</h3>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, you are able to strike subtly to exploit a foe's distraction. When you have advantage on the attack roll, are attacking an opponent that is surprised, or an enemy is within 5 feet of an ally, you deal extra damage as shown on the table. In order to deal this extra damage, you must be wielding a ranged weapon or a finesse weapon. You may only deal this extra damage once per turn.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="thievesCant">
            <h3>Thieves' Cant</h3>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, you have learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

                In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a criminal guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for criminals on the run.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="etherealBlade">
            <h3>Ethereal Blade</h3>
            <p>Starting at the 1st level, you are granted an ethereal blade from the Gods. This is a magical melee weapon that deals 2d10 damage and has the finesse and two-handed properties. This blade emits an unwavering godly aura that can be felt by creatures within 30 feet. This intimidating aura allows you to roll advantage on intimidation checks. The ethereal blade also provides defensive properties. While holding this blade, you cannot be disarmed. Whenever you take magical damage, roll a d20. On a roll of 5-10, you take half the damage. On a roll higher than 10, you take no damage. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="holyGun"> 
            <h3>Holy Gun</h3>
            <p>At level 2, the holy spirit grants you his weapon, Alekhine's Gun. This is a magical ranged weapoon with a range of 100/120 feet. Its damage is 3d10 + your dexterity modifier. Alekhine's gun specializes in battery and control; if an enemy is within 10 feet of an ally, you hit a critical on rolls of 10-20. </p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="athenaShield">
            <h3>Athena's Shield</h3>
            <p>Starting at level 3, you gain Athena's shield. Athena's shield protects you from all physical attacks, granting you immunity to all melee damage for 18 seconds. In addition, all magical damage you receive instead heals you for that amount. While using Athena's shield, you become more restricted, causing damage you deal to be halved. After using Athena's shield, it must recharge for at least a minute before being used again. </p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="Kamehameha"> 
            <h3>Kamehameha</h3>
            <p>At level 4, the gods grant you the knowledge to properly use the Kamehameha, an ability thought to only exist in Japanese mythology. Once per long rest, you may charge an energy beam and fire it at the enemy. This ability has a maximum range of 50 feet, and does 6d10 damage to the target. If you are within 5 feet of the enemy, this ability's damage is upgraded to 8d10.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Rasengan"> 
            <h3>Rasengan</h3>
            <p>At level 4, you learn the Rasengan. It is said that this ability is the purest form of magic. Three times per long rest, you can create a ball of energy that does high melee damage. This ability does 3d8 damage + your dexterity modifier. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="hermesBoots"> 
            <h3>Hermes' Boots</h3>
            <p>At level 5, you can harness the power of Hermes' boots. For 60 minutes per day, you can manifest these boots, doubling your movement speed. During combat, you get two attacks every turn: One during your turn, and one after everyone has had their turn. Additionally, you get two extra bonus actions  per turn. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="lucifersCrux"> 
            <h3>Lucifer's Crux</h3>
            <p>At level 6, Lucifer allows you to channel his power. For ten minutes every 48 hours, all of your attacks have advantage and automatically hit for critical damage. In addition, all damage you receive is halved. If Athena's shield is activated, the length of her shield is extended to the same duration as Lucifer's Crux. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Deathnote"> 
            <h3>God of Death's Notebook</h3>
            <p>At level 7, you are given a notebook with special properties. If you write someone's full name in the book while picturing that person's face, that person dies in 40 seconds of a heart attack. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="jehovahsWitness"> 
            <h3>Jehovah's Winess</h3>
            <p>At level 7, you become the God of espionage. Once per week, you can summon a Jehovah's witness who can pray to Jehovah, granting you the ability to read the minds of the next three people you come within 10 feet of. You have advantage on persuasion, intimidation, and deception checks against these three people. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="abilityScore"> 
            <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
            <p>When you reach the 9th level you can increase one ability score of your choice by 6, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 3. </p>
